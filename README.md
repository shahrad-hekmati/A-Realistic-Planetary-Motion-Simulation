# inner_space_Simulation
In this program, I used pygame and math libraries for simulating the planet movement based on the formulas for gravity and our solar system structure when you change the mass or velocity of objects(plants) it will change their movement pattern.
Note that there will always be a large object with a gravitational center, which in this example is the sun.
