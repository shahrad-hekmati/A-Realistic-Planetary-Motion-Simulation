# inner_space_Simulation
in this program i used pygame and math librarys for simulating the planet movement based on the formulas for gravity and our solar system structure when you change mass or velocity of objects(plants) it will change thier movement patern.
Note that there will always be a large object with a gravitational center, which in this example is the sun.
